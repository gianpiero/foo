TempMonitor
==========

This is a Xcode project that illustrates how simple is to integrate data published using RTI Connext DDS with a third party service such as [Parse](http://www.parse.com/)
[RTI Prototpyper with Lua](http://community.rti.com/downloads/experimental/rti-prototyper-with-lua) is used to read a temperature sensor from a [RTI Connext DDS](http://www.rti.com/products/dds/index.html) publisher and store them on an third party service. 
This simple iOs application allows you to connect to the Parse database and display the data on your phone. 

How to Run
----------

1. Clone the repository and open the Xcode project.
